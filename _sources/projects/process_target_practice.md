# Creating quantitative data from an image

In this _preview_ notebook, we will generate the location of board hits by clicking on an image displayed by matplotlib. We will repeat this process in the next Module_03-IVPs. 

The first step is to import the libraries we need, the new functions here are 

- `imread`:Â a function that creates a numpy array that can be plotted with plt.imshow

- `%matplotlib notebook`: is a "magic" command that allows for an interactive matplotlib figure. There's one extra plotting step of creating a figure before plotting with `plt.figure()`

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.image import imread
import numpy as np
%matplotlib notebook
```

# Read in images target_01 and target_02

Now we read in target_01.jpg and target_02.jpg into variables `im1` and `im2`. These are the images of the whiteboard. The black lines are perpendicular to each other and 36" (0.9144 m) long. We'll display `im1` to start.

```{code-cell} ipython3
im1 = imread('../data/target_01.jpg')
im2 = imread('../data/target_02.jpg')
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(im1)
```

### Capture mouse clicks on the frame

Okay! Here is where things get really interesting. Matplotlib has the ability to create [event connections](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/users/event_handling.html?highlight=mpl_connect), that is, connect the figure canvas to user-interface events on it, like mouse clicks. 

To use this ability, you write a function with the events you want to capture, and then connect this function to the Matplotlib "event manager" using [`mpl_connect()`](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/backend_bases_api.html#matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase.mpl_connect). In this case, we connect the `'button_press_event'` to the function named `onclick()`, which captures the $(x,y)$ coordinates of the mouse click on the figure. Magic!

```{code-cell} ipython3
def onclick(event):
    '''Capture the x,y coordinates of a mouse click on the image'''
    ix, iy = event.xdata, event.ydata
    coords.append([ix, iy]) 
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig = plt.figure(3)
plt.imshow(im1, interpolation='nearest')

coords = []
connectId = fig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onclick)
```

Notice that in the previous code cell, we created an empty list named `coords`, and inside the `onclick()` function, we are appending to it the $(x,y)$ coordinates of each mouse click on the figure. After executing the cell above, you have a connection to the figure, via the user interface: try clicking with your mouse on the endpoints of the white lines of the metered panel (click on the edge of the panel to get approximately equal $x$ coordinates), then print the contents of the `coords` list below.

```{code-cell} ipython3
coords
```

The $x$ coordinates are pretty close, but there is some variation due to our shaky hand (or bad eyesight), and perhaps because the metered panel is not perfectly vertical. We can cast the `coords` list to a NumPy array, then grab all the first elements of the coordinate pairs, then get the standard deviation as an indication of our error in the mouse-click captures.

## Save your work to a file

In the next two code cells, we assign the clicks that were in the list `coords` to a numpy array `hits1`. Then, we save this array to the file `hits_im1.npy`. This is a numpy-readable file that we can load back into our workspace later as `np.load('../data/hits_im1.npy')`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
hits1 = np.array(coords)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.save('../data/hits_im1.npy',hits1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(im1)

plt.plot(hits1[:,0],hits1[:,1],'x')
#plt.plot(rings[:,0],rings[:,1],'s')
```

# Rinse and repeat

Now we will repeat the process for `hits2` collecting the hit locations in target_02.jpg.

### Capture mouse clicks on the frame

Once again we create [event connections](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/users/event_handling.html?highlight=mpl_connect), that is, connect the figure canvas to user-interface events on it, like mouse clicks. 
We connect the `'button_press_event'` to the function named `onclick()`, which captures the $(x,y)$ coordinates of the mouse click on the figure. Magic!

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig = plt.figure()
plt.imshow(im2, interpolation='nearest')

coords = []
connectId = fig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onclick)
```

The $x$ coordinates are pretty close, but there is some variation due to our shaky hand (or bad eyesight), and perhaps because the metered panel is not perfectly vertical. We can cast the `coords` list to a NumPy array, then grab all the first elements of the coordinate pairs, then get the standard deviation as an indication of our error in the mouse-click captures.

```{code-cell} ipython3
hits2 = np.array(coords)
```

## Save your work to a file

In the next two code cells, we assign the clicks that were in the list `coords` to a numpy array `hits2`. Then, we save this array to the file `hits_im2.npy`. This is a numpy-readable file that we can load back into our workspace later as `np.load('../data/hits_im2.npy')`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.save('../data/hits_im2.npy',hits2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(im2)

plt.plot(hits2[:,0],hits2[:,1],'x')
```

## Set the scale to convert pixels -> meters

In the next two `imshow` commands, we will choose the corners of the target shown below as location 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the center we will determine from the average locations of locations 1-4 in $\times$ . 

![Target dimensions and click locations](../images/target.png)

We use the same `onclick` function to create the `corners1` array for target_01.jpg and `corners2` for targete_02.jpg. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig = plt.figure()
plt.imshow(im1, interpolation='nearest')

coords = []
connectId = fig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onclick)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
corners1 =np.array(coords)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig = plt.figure()
plt.imshow(im2, interpolation='nearest')

coords = []
connectId = fig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onclick)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
corners2 =np.array(coords)
```

## Set the absolute position and scale results

With the corner locations save in the `corners1` and `corners2`, we locate the target center as the average x-position and average y-position of all four chosen points. Below, we plot the corners and centers for both images, you can change the `imshow` command to check target_01.jpg and target_02.jpg. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.figure()

center1_x = np.mean(corners1[:,0])
center1_y = np.mean(corners1[:,1])

center2_x = np.mean(corners2[:,0])
center2_y = np.mean(corners2[:,1])

plt.imshow(im1)

plt.plot(corners1[:,0],corners1[:,1],'o')
plt.plot(corners2[:,0],corners2[:,1],'s')

plt.plot(center1_x,center1_y,'+')
plt.plot(center2_x,center2_y,'x')
plt.plot(1500,2500,'s')
plt.xlabel('y-axis')
plt.ylabel('x-axis')
```

You can see above that each image will have a different scale to convert from position in pixels to position in meters. This is the case for all quantitative image data, every time a camera is repositioned you will have a new scale to convert pixels to meters. 

Below, we use the 0.9144-m distance between corner locations to set oour `im1_scale` and `im2_scale` for target_01.jpg and target_02.jpg, respectively. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
d1=np.sqrt((corners1[0,0]-corners1[1,0])**2+(corners1[0,1]-corners1[1,1])**2)
d2=np.sqrt((corners1[2,0]-corners1[3,0])**2+(corners1[2,1]-corners1[3,1])**2)


im1_scale = 0.9144/np.mean([d1,d2]) # in 0.9144 meters/ pixel distance
print('target_01.jpg has conversion {:.2} meter/pixel'.format(im1_scale))
d1=np.sqrt((corners2[0,0]-corners2[1,0])**2+(corners2[0,1]-corners2[1,1])**2)
d2=np.sqrt((corners2[2,0]-corners2[3,0])**2+(corners2[2,1]-corners2[3,1])**2)


im2_scale = 0.9144/np.mean([d1,d2]) # in 0.9144 meters/ pixel distance
print('target_02.jpg has conversion {:.2} meter/pixel'.format(im2_scale))
```

# Final Data preparation

So far, we have

1. Chosen hit points on two images

2. Chosen calibration points on two images

2. Determined a local reference in each image i.e. point (0,0)

3. Determined the scale for each image i.e. convert pixels -> meters

The final data preparation is to convert the chosen hit points on the two images into (x,y) locations in meters. We will save some other information in case we need to check our work later _(part of creating reproducible research)_.

The first step is to plot our scaled and centered data from targets 01 and 02. We can also plot the mean location of our hits from the class. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
hits1=np.load('./hits_im1.npy')
hits2=np.load('./hits_im2.npy')

center_hits1=hits1
center_hits1[:,0]= hits1[:,0]-center1_x
center_hits1[:,1]= hits1[:,1]-center1_y

center_hits2=hits2
center_hits2[:,0]= hits2[:,0]-center2_x
center_hits2[:,1]= hits2[:,1]-center2_y

scaled_hits1 = center_hits1*im1_scale
scaled_hits2 = center_hits2*im2_scale

plt.figure()
plt.plot(scaled_hits1[:,0],scaled_hits1[:,1],'x')
plt.plot(scaled_hits2[:,0],scaled_hits2[:,1],'x')

plt.plot(np.mean(scaled_hits1[:,0]),np.mean(scaled_hits1[:,1]),'o',label='mean hit target_01')
plt.plot(np.mean(scaled_hits2[:,0]),np.mean(scaled_hits2[:,1]),'o',label='mean hit target_02')
plt.legend()
```

The locations look good so far, now we export the data to a csv file so we can access it later. 

The csv file will save the following information:

|throw #| x position (m)| y position (m)|picture x position (pixel)| picture y position (pixel)|target x position (pixel)| target y position (pixel)| image #|
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------|----------|---------|----------|--------|
|arbitrary hit #|centered x position|centered y position|absolute x pixel location|absoluter y pixel location|target center x pixel location|target center y pixel location |either 1 or 2 for target_01.jpg or target_02.jpg|


```{code-cell} ipython3
hits1=np.load('../data/hits_im1.npy')
hits2=np.load('../data/hits_im2.npy')
file = open('../data/target_data.csv','w')
file.write('throw #, x position (m), y position (m),')
file.write('picture x position (pixel), picture y position (pixel),')
file.write('target x position (pixel), target y position (pixel), image #\n')
for i in range(0,len(scaled_hits1)):
    file.write('{},{},{},'.format(i,scaled_hits1[i,0],scaled_hits1[i,1]))
    file.write('{},{},'.format(hits1[i,0],hits1[i,1]))
    file.write('{},{},{}\n'.format(center1_x,center1_y,1))
for i in range(0,len(scaled_hits2)):
    file.write('{},{},{},'.format(len(scaled_hits1)+i,scaled_hits2[i,0],scaled_hits2[i,1]))
    file.write('{},{},'.format(hits2[i,0],hits2[i,1]))
    file.write('{},{},{}\n'.format(center2_x,center2_y,2))
file.close()
```

# Congratulations

Now you can do some statistics on accuracy and precision of the class by loading the csv into a `pandas` dataframe.
